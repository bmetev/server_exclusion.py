# server_exclusion.py
A small script that I wrote for a customer and colleagues.
Taking a list of servers from .CSV file (each CI is on a different row) and convert them to one line in which every CI is separated by quotes, comma, and space between them. 
As a second part of the script, servers can be excluded by name from the list wich was already prepared.
